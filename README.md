# Doherty Printing

This project was created for my mother’s small business. She sells memorial cards and wedding stationery. 
She wanted a place where she could display pictures of her cards to customers and establish a presence on 
the web. The purpose of this site was to inform customers what Doherty Printing sells, who they are and to display 
a portfolio of their cards for customers to view them. 

# UX
As part of this project I had two different target audiences, so I created two user personas.

1. Memorial cards

Name: Mary Donavan

Statement:
“I have just lost my husband and I need something that reminds me of him. I want someone who is friendly and easy to deal with in these sensitive times. I prefer to shop local and talk directly to the supplier”

Age: 65
Gender: Woman
Location: within the Limerick Area.
Looks at Word of Mouth or reviews when ordering memorial cards.
Occupation: retired
Motivation: Want a reminder of someone they lost. 
Pain Points: Just lost someone and need a friendly supplier.
Attitudes: Like to support local businesses.
End Goals: Use Word of Mouth mainly and search on google for memorial cards. They also want something personal to remind them of what they have lost.
Scenario: Better prices than competitors and we are a small local business. They would keep the card in their wallet or on their mantel piece. We can relieve some of the pain points by offering an affordable product and a more personal approach by talking with the owner and having a friendly customer service. They need to trust the owner which is why reviews are so important.

2. Wedding stationery

Name: Julie O’ Shea

Psychographics

Motivation: will come to Doherty Printing because of price and the quality. Supporting a small local business is a factor too.
End Goals: Google and Social Media. Reviews are very important. 
Scenario: They buy the product because it is tradition to invite people through invitation it looks much more prestigious and the event looks fancy. We can relieve some of the pain points by offering the best price in the market for high quality cards. 

## Strategy

I had two strategy’s for this website.
1. Have a place where my mother could showcase her portfolio of work. She did not want an ecommerce site as she is working for herself and would not have the time to look after it and she prefers dealing with people face to face so she gets the design of the card correct.

I completed this strategy by creating different galleries for each different card that Doherty Printing sells. Now she has an online brochure that customers can search for and view her past work.

2. Get people to contact Doherty Printing about the price of their cards as they do have the lowest prices in Ireland. 

I focused on inserting as many calls to actions as I could on each page and wrote content that highlighted the high quality and affordable prices that Doherty Printing is offerring. I want to add the prices to the images in the gallery once I know javascript so people can slick on the image and see a shoort description of each card with the price and card number beside the image. The potential customer can then message my mam with the card number to order their batch of cards.

## Scope
* The user needs to know who the company is and what they do.
The title in the header section will answer this question straight away so the user will know whether this site meets their needs or not. The brief description "What We Do" under the header will detail exactly what products my mam sells and where the company is located.

* The user needs to trust the company.
The links to Doherty Printing's social media in the footer will establish trust as they have a good social media following and a few review’s built up. 
Also, the fact that the user will be talking to the supplier directly rather then paying for the cards online without talking to someone will establish trust, especially in the memorial card target audience as they prefer to talk to someone before purchasing.

* The user will need to view pictures of the product.
I took realistic pictures of the cards so people can see the quality of the card. The pictures of the cards are then put into different galleries depending on the category. The user can then locate the product they are looking for in the navbar.

* If the user sees a card that they like they can fill out the contact form that is located on each page and ask for a qoute. 
Once I know javascript I will be able to make the galleries more interactive so as to include a card number that they can use to show the owner the specific card they are interested in.

## Structure

The business is targeting two sectors, so I made one general homepage and two other homepages, one for Memorial Cards and one for Wedding Stationery. I wanted to create a seperate homepage for memorial cards and wedding stationery as it will target those keywords specifically when people search for them on Google and it will bring them to the page, they want from directly from Google search. This will make it easier for the prospect to find what they are looking for quicker.

### Customer searching for memorial cards/wedding invites.

1. Deos a Google search memorial cards/wedding invites, Limerick.

3. Clicks on memorial cards/wedding invites to view the pictures of memorial cards on the website.

If the user deos not want to read all this extra information they can go directly to the page they want in the navbar where a dropdown toggle will exist and will provide links to the gallery that the user is looking for.

# Features

* In the heading I wanted to add a carousel of images sliding to show off the product. This allows the user to see the product the miniute they click onto the website.
* I added in the hover effect using CSS on the "Our Products2 section. This show the user you can click on these boxes and they will take you to a desired destination.
* I inserted a navbar dropdown menu. This will help the user find the galleries which showcase the cards much quicker then if they were to scroll on the page.
* I linked the website to the company’s social media pages. This will take the consumer to Doherty printing's social media to see reviews about the product.
* I added in a number of calls to actions which all relate to our end goal which is getting people to email the supplier about the cards.

### Features I would like to add in the future
* I want to add in a javascript gallery which will allow the user to click on the image and see the image in a bigger size with a short desription about the product and the price.

## Technologies Used

Languages: HTML and CSS

Framework: Bootstrap
* I used Bootstrap for the sliding carousel in the header and to make certain sections of the website reposive.  

Libraries: Google Fonts and Font Awesome 
* I used the roboto text for the entire website and I used Font Awesome for the icons in the footer.

* Adobe-Indesign
Used for the layout of my design.

* Adobe Photoshop:
Used to edit or crop my photos to size.


## Testing

1. All the links in the navbar are working. This will make it quicker for ussers to navigate around the site and get to the page they want.
2. I inserted a video on the homepage for wedding stationery and the controls are working so users can play the video with audio if the want or make the video bigger. This will allow them to see the products virtually over video before getting in touch with us.
3. I have clicked all the links in the "Our Products" section. There is one that is not connected on the wedding stationery page and this is because I have no pictures of the mass booklets yet, but I will be uploading them soon.
4. I have checked the social media links in the footer which all connect up to the company’s social media. 
5. I used the WS3 Validators for HTML and CSS to debug any errors on each page of the website. There were not too many bugs except for forgetting to add the alt text to some pictures, changing the font weight of the heading from 570 to 600 and changing the font style from bold.
6. I checked Lightroom in Developers tools to make sure that nothing had a score of under 50%, everything had a score of 75% and higher.
7. I have checked every screen size and have made sure that the site looks good on all screen sizes. Getting the measurements for the carousel of pictures in the header was a challenge as it would change at every screen size, so I had to be very precise with with the measurements and I used media queries to get the exact size.


## Credits

* [Code Sonia](https://codesonia.github.io/CodeSonia_Personal_Portfolio/): I was having trouble getting my navbar to go to the right so I had a look at Code Sonia's code to see how she did it and used that to get the elements in the navbar to stay at the right.
